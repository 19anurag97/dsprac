Tree Data Structure.
It is a hierarchical data Structure. Unlike Array/Linkedlists.

Tree Traversal Techniques:

(1) DFS
-> Inorder {Left -> Root -> Right}
-> Preorder
-> Postorder

(2) BFS (Level Order)


Time Complexity - It takes worst case time complexity of O(n) during Insertion/Deletion/Searching operations,
                    where n is total number of nodes in a tree.
